# My readline config
Use if you like, not much special here, just like having my terminal have vi-like behaviour

### Notes
- `set editing-mode vi` enables vi mode for most shells *test if valid for macOS*
- `set echo-control-characters off` in `~/.inputrc` disables the `^C` echo when ctrl+c is pressed
